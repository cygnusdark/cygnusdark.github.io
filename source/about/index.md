> 「Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do
what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you 
haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know 
when you find it. 」 — Steve Jobs
